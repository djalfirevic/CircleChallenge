Architecture with reusability in mind.

Specification
GitHub search API documentation.
UI and UX are up to you (simplicity, reusability, and familiarity are key).

Great implementation of base features is better than a good implementation of both base and bonus features.
Avoid 3rd-party dependencies, if possible.
